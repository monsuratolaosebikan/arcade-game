# BugHop -  Frogger Arcade Game Clone

The purpose of this project was to create a clone of the popular arcade frogger where the objective of the game is to cross the road safely using HTML5 canvas and object oriented JavaScript. The images, game engine and image loading utility were provided by Udacity.

### How to Play
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the character across the board to the water to gain points. Make sure you don't hit any bugs or you'll lose a life. The game resets once all lives have been lost.
